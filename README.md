🎮 Ping Pong Game in Assembly Language
📋 Project Description
This is a simple Ping Pong game developed using Assembly Language. The project demonstrates the implementation of core game mechanics, such as ball movement, collision detection, and paddle control, all achieved at a low level using CPU instructions.

This project aims to:

Explore low-level programming concepts.
Understand CPU operations and memory management.
Optimize performance within resource constraints.
🚀 Features
Ball Movement: Smooth vertical and horizontal ball motion.
Paddle Control: Move paddles up and down using keyboard inputs.
Collision Detection: Ball bounces off paddles and screen boundaries.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of player scores.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Assembly Language
x86 Architecture
Emulator: DOSBox / Any x86 Assembly Emulator
⚙️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ping-pong-assembly.git
cd ping-pong-assembly
Assemble the code using an assembler (e.g., NASM or TASM).
Example with NASM:

bash
Copy code
nasm -f bin pingpong.asm -o pingpong.com
Run the program using DOSBox or your preferred emulator:

bash
Copy code
dosbox pingpong.com
🎮 Controls
Player 1 (Left Paddle):

Move Up: W
Move Down: S
Player 2 (Right Paddle):

Move Up: ↑ (Arrow Up)
Move Down: ↓ (Arrow Down)
